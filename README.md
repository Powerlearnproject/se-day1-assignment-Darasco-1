#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the aspect of engineering that involves the process of designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software systems and applications, using engineering principles, tools, and methods. This is a discipline that deals with the building and maintainance of the programs and apps that used on our computer, smart phones e.t.c following systemactic processes. 
Software engineering is of tremendious importance to our technology industry in that its ability to ensure quality, efficiency, scalability, and customer satisfaction while fostering innovation and maintaining competitive advantage has been developed.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming (1960-1970): it involves introducing a more organized method of writing codes, and implementing the use of functions, and control structures like looops
Object-Oriented Programming(1980): This inolves the use of modules and classes which results in reusable codes, leading to efficient development processes
Agile Methodology(2001): This involves the intoduction of breaking development approaches into smaller, flexible and iterative processes. It shifts away from the more linear rigid method of development(waterfall).

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: this involves gathering data on the uses of the software, user needs and the system requirements
Design: this involves planning the intricases of the software like user interface, database design and system interfaces. How the user will interact with the software, how data is colleted and stored and what nots.
Implementation: this is the process of writing the codes based on all the planning and design done aforehand. this when writing the codebase is done mainly.
Testing: This is the process to taking test run of the software to see if it mmet the required needs and specifications.
Deployment: During this phase, the software product is released to be used by users
Maintenance: FOr this phase, updates to the codebase, debugguing, and ongoing support is provided.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall involves the more traditional linear approach where the development of the software is split into phases, and without finishing one of the phase another phase wont begin, WHILE,  Agile methodology involves breaking down the develpoments into small increamental cycles which promotes flexibility. Waterfall approach is appropriate for large complex project and agile approach is useful for software startups or web applicaiton development. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is the personnel in charge of writing and implements the codes for the software based on the design
Qualiity Assurance engineer is in charge of verifying that the software meets the qiality standard and specification for which it is needed by planning and performing the automates testing.
Project Manager: this is the personnel in charge of overseeing the project from start to finish. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment(IDE) provides environment and tools that help developers write, test, and debug code. Examples are visual studio, intelliJ IDEA, Eclipse
Version Control Systems(VCS) these helps to track changes in code, and helps developers collaborate together. Examples are git(With github, GitLab)


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight dealines: If there is a way of having prototypes at the ready that can just be changed on demand. this will make developers work faster. Departmentalizing development process and assign to groups to work on, can help the development of the software to proceed faster.
Changing requirements: Having proper and seamless communication that can allow for any specification change to be seamlessly applied. Prioritizing tasks and using of project management tools that can be a strategy. 
Technical debt and debugging of complex codes: adopting of agile approach and breaking work into manageble sprints can allow for debugging to be carried out section by section. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: involves testing the individual component to assertain that they work as expected.
Integration testing: invoves testing the interaction between differnt component or systems to make sure that they work cohenrently.
System Testing: this involves testing the software as a whole to ensure it meets the required specifications
Acceptance testing: this involvs testing the software in the real-world environment to ensure it meets the needs of the stakeholders.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of defining, issuing or crafting an instruction or command to an AI or language model to get a desired output.
the potential of implementing AI and robots into our daily tasks is enormous but has not yet been properly utilized, because good, well-crafted prompts have not been taught or developed.Giving specifc and clear instructions to AI models will help in providing better desired results, saving time and improving efficiency. Developing the ability to generate good prompts is essential to harnessing and maximizing the use of AI and robotics, hence the importance of prompt engineering.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about sandwiches" or "define the word prompt" are vague prompt.
Instead "give me a step-by-step process of recipe for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich" or "what is prompt in terms of prompt engineering" are better prompts. this is because it provides context, gives a specific, clear and structured command to provide clearer result.
